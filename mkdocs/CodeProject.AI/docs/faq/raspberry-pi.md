## You must install .NET to run this application

You may have already installed the dev environment on your Pi, but the latest version of the .NET runtime or SDK may have been updated and you will need to manually update .NET.

Go to */src/Scripts* in a terminal on your Pi and run

sudo bash dotnet-install-rpi.sh
```
